// Media Queries
//
// Defines our default breakpoints.  Assumes mobile-first code, but supports not
// by passing your breakpoint to the alternate mixin: `mq-lt`. Don't worry about
// having a ton of these, since the minification process will combine them.
//
// There's also a separate mixin each for `portrait` and `landscape` orientations.
//
// ```
// @include mq($breakpoint) {
//   @content;
// }
// @include portrait {
//   @content;
// }
// @include landscape {
//   @content;
// }
// ```
//
// $breakpoint - what size you'd like to target larger than. A few have been pre-defined.
// @content - the content to put in the media query
//
// Styleguide I.3

// Pre-defined breakpoints

// Breakpoints saved to variables for easy acces. Note that the breakpoints are
// not based on devices, and the device name in parenthesis is just for
// simplification.

// $bp-medium - the breakpoint between small (phone) and medium (tablet) layouts.
// $bp-large - the breakpoint between medium (tablet) and large (desktop) layouts.
